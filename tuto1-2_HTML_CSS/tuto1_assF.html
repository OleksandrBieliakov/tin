  <p class="article">
    Cats is a 2019 musical fantasy film based on the 1981 Tony Award-winning stage musical of the same name by Andrew Lloyd Webber, which in turn was based on the poetry collection <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Possum%27s_Book_of_Practical_Cats">Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats (1939)</a> by T. S. Eliot. The film is directed by Tom Hooper—in his second feature musical following Les Misérables (2012)—from a screenplay by Lee Hall and Hooper and features an ensemble cast, including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.

  <h2 class="header">Smelly cat</h2>
  <p class="article">
    "Smelly Cat" is a comedy song from the American sitcom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends">Friends</a> (1994–2004), originally performed by American actress Lisa Kudrow. The song was written by Friends writers Adam Chase and Betsy Borns, with musician Chrissie Hynde and Kudrow for the latter's character Phoebe Buffay, and first appears in the sixth episode of the show's second season, "The One with the Baby on the Bus". Hynde guest stars in the episode as a singer hired to replace Phoebe as Central Perk's in-house musician, to whom Phoebe eventually teaches "Smelly Cat". Borns originally intended to write the song about a dog, initially basing it on her own pet dog Gouda, but ultimately decided that a song about a pungent cat would be funnier.

  "Soft Kitty" is a children's song, popularized by the characters Sheldon and Penny in the American sitcom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory"> The Big Bang Theory</a>, and which elsewhere may be rendered as "Warm Kitty". According to claims in a copyright lawsuit, the words to "Warm Kitty" were written by Edith Newlin.
   <br>
   In The Big Bang Theory, the song is described by Sheldon as a song sung by his mother when he is ill. The lyrics on The Big Bang Theory are: "Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur! Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr!" A scene in an episode of Young Sheldon, the prequel series to The Big Bang Theory, depicts the origin of the song. This aired on February 1, 2018, and shows Sheldon's mother Mary singing the song to her son, who is suffering with the flu.
